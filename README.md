# Repository Overview

This repository contains Python scripts used for analyzing and comparing model performance in river channel characteristics. Below is a brief description of the scripts included:

## `kfold_all_c.py`

This script calculates the model parameters and p-values based on cross-validation results for Model C exclusively.

## `kfold_*1_*2.py`

This script is designed to compare the accuracy of models A through D across different variables for each river segment. The naming convention is as follows:

- `*1` denotes the flood condition (`F`) or normal condition (`N`).
- `*2` represents the river segment, with options including `seg1`, `seg2_1`, or `seg2_2`.
